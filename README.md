## Features

This project includes set of features aimed at enhancing user experience and maintainability:

**React Router-Based Modal**

Modal navigation is fully integrated with React Router. Clicking on an item opens a modal that behaves like a route change — allowing deep linking and browser navigation support.

**Overview Page with Filtering & Charting**

The overview page provides an interactive interface where users can
filter content by platform

**Dark & Light Mode Support**

The application supports both dark and light themes, automatically adjusting UI elements to provide optimal readability and aesthetics.

**Custom Modal Background Gradient**

Due to the theme switching feature, the modal background includes a custom gradient to ensure visual consistency and clarity across both dark and light modes.

**Responsive Design**

The UI is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices of all sizes—from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
